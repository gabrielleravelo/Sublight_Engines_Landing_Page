# Sublight Engines Landing Page

This week, the project consists of creating a website with HTML and CSS following a predefined template.

## Template

The template link is below 

https://www.figma.com/file/8jBCJGinoHhn4wj7N2K7R2/Sublight-Engines-Landing-Page?node-id=0%3A1

## How to proceed

I put all the elements needed (text/paragraph, images/icons, ...) in HTML file and I customised the website with the CSS file (color, size, margin, ...).

The project is divided in 6 sections : 

- header/hero section, 
- services section
- about us section
- products section
- contact us section  
- and the footer.
